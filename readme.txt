Allows your site visitors to download free files right away without making them go to the checkout page.

== Description ==

Do you want to set up a download button for free files? Easy Digital Downloads has the free download feature. However, the visitor has to go to the checkout page and fill the form after clicking on the purchase button.

This plugin bypasses that process and lets them download the file right away.

= Supports Download Counts =

Each download is counted as a payment as EDD natively handles. So you know how many times your files are downloaded. If it is downloaded by a logged-in user, you would know who downloaded what.

= Lightweight =
This is super lightweight and does not insert any plugin specific options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload **`immediate-free-download-for-easy-digital-downloads.php`** and other files compressed in the zip folder to the **`/wp-content/plugins/`** directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Create a Download with the price of `0`. The plugin automatically detect it and replace the checkout button to a free download link.
